<h1>Toxic Chemical Heatmap</h1>
<h4>by Michael Yufa-Zimilevich</h4>
<p>This project was made in collaboration with the <b>University of Michigan Eco Data Club</b></p>
&nbsp;
<h2>Mission</h2><p>The goal of this project is to create heatmaps of toxic chemicals that were detected at above Minimum Reporting Level (MRL) in the State of Michigan</p>
&nbsp;
<h2>Future Developments</h2>
<p>
<li>CLI with automated dataset loading</li>
<li>Adaptation for multiple states and regional subsets</li>
<li>Selection of multiple subtypes from a given contaminant category i.e PFAS -> PFOS, PFHpA, PFHxS, etc</li>
</p>
